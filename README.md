# Pubmed Search Frontend

An ugly but functional frontend for [it's companion API](https://github.com/mark-restrepo/nih-backend).

## Installation

Installation requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mark-restrepo/nih-frontend.git
cd nih-frontend
npm install
```

The app can then be run with:

```bash
npm start
```

If setup was successful, you should be able to view the application at http://localhost:3030/. Please note that if you have not run [the backend](https://github.com/mark-restrepo/nih-backend), you will get errors trying to search anything.
